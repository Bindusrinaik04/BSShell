Shell - A Basic Linux Command Executor
This repository contains a simple shell implementation that executes basic Linux commands. The shell supports the following commands:

ps: Displays information about active processes.
ls: Lists directory contents.
cat: Concatenates and displays the content of files.
echo: Displays a line of text or variables.
mkdir: Creates new directories.
cdir: Changes the current directory (similar to cd).
wc: Displays the word, line, and byte counts for files.
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of shell scripting and command execution, providing a simple yet functional interface for interacting with a Linux-based system. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how shells operate and manage processes.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements!
