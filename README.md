# BSShell - A Basic Linux Command Executor
Shell - A Basic Linux Command Executor
This repository contains a simple shell implementation that executes basic Linux commands. The shell supports the following commands:

1.ps: Displays information about active processes.

2. ls: Lists directory contents.

3. cat: Concatenates and displays the content of files.
4.echo: Displays a line of text or variables.
5.mkdir: Creates new directories.
6.cdir: Changes the current directory (similar to cd).
7.wc: Displays the word, line, and byte counts for files.
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of shell scripting and command execution, providing a simple yet functional interface for interacting with a Linux-based system. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how shells operate and manage processes.
